# Python - Boilerplate

## Requirements:
Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Test your installation
```bash
python -v
```

## Testing

We are using the [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) testing framework for testing. No explicit installation is required for it.

To run all the tests, run:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

To run a specific test, run:

```bash
python -m unittest <test_file.py>
```

## Running the application

We have setup `main.py` as the entry point file. To run it, run the command:

```bash
python main.py
```
